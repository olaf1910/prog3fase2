# Admin User Management Implementation

This guide explains how the admin user management functionality has been implemented in the mobile app, matching the web application's capabilities.

## Components Created

1. **GerirUtilizadoresScreen.js**
   - Main screen for user management
   - Features:
     - User listing with details (username, email, role, creation date)
     - Search functionality
     - Pull-to-refresh
     - Loading states
     - Error handling
     - Access control for admin users only

2. **AddUserModal.js**
   - Modal component for creating new users
   - Features:
     - Form with validation for all fields
     - Role selection using Picker
     - Password complexity validation
     - Error handling for API errors
     - Loading states during form submission

3. **EditUserModal.js**
   - Modal component for editing existing users
   - Features:
     - Pre-filled form with user data
     - Role management
     - Form validation
     - Loading states during form submission
     - Error handling

## Integration with Navigation

The AdminScreen is already integrated in `AppNavigator.js` and is conditionally shown only to users with the admin role:

```javascript
{utilizador?.funcao === 'admin' && (
  <Stack.Screen
    name="GerirUtilizadores"
    component={GerirUtilizadoresScreen}
    options={{
      headerTitle: 'Gerir Utilizadores',
    }}
  />
)}
```

## API Integration

The implementation uses the existing `utilizadorServico.js` which provides all necessary methods:
- `procurarTodosOsUtilizadores()` - Get all users
- `procurarUtilizadorPorId(id)` - Get user by ID
- `criarUtilizador(dadosUtilizador)` - Create new user
- `atualizarUtilizador(utilizadorId, dadosUtilizador)` - Update user
- `eliminarUtilizador(utilizadorId)` - Delete user

## Dependencies Added

- @react-native-picker/picker - Used for the role selection dropdown in forms

## Testing the Implementation

To test this implementation:

1. **Login as an Admin User**
   - Use admin credentials to log in to the app

2. **Access the User Management Screen**
   - Navigate to the Profile tab
   - Tap on "Gerir Utilizadores" option

3. **Test User Listing and Search**
   - Verify all users are displayed correctly
   - Use the search bar to filter users by name or email

4. **Test Adding a New User**
   - Tap the "+" FAB button
   - Fill in user details and create
   - Verify the new user appears in the list

5. **Test Editing a User**
   - Tap "Edit" on an existing user
   - Modify data and save
   - Verify changes are reflected in the list

6. **Test Deleting a User**
   - Tap "Delete" on a user
   - Confirm deletion
   - Verify the user is removed from the list

7. **Access Control Verification**
   - Log in with non-admin accounts
   - Verify they cannot access the admin user management screen

## Security Considerations

- The implementation enforces role-based access control
- All user inputs are validated on both client and server sides
- Password complexity requirements match the web application
- Sensitive operations (delete, edit) have confirmation dialogs
- API errors are handled gracefully with user-friendly messages

This implementation fully matches the functionality available in the web application but is optimized for mobile interaction patterns and screen sizes.
